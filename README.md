### Tower of Hanoi game with auto-solve

Midterm project for DSA class where we use JavaScript games to understand/demonstrate the concepts - in this case stacks (the towers) and recursion (the auto-solve function).

Live at https://jakobagger.github.io/dsa-hanoi/

## Possible improvements/current issues:

* Currently, it is possible to crash the game if you use the auto-solve after having moved some discs yourself. 
* While it it looks much nicer than it would if I hadn't stolen most of the CSS, it isn't responsive at all-
* The JavaScript code is sperated somewhat in files but all the game code could be better separated in an MVC pattern probably
